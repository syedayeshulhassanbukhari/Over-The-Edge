# Over the Edge

A 2D platformer built in Unreal Engine 5. Over the Edge is a fun project that showcases the implementation of what I have learned so far, inspired by classic Super Mario-style platforming. The goal is a complete, polished game experience rather than just a learning prototype.

## Highlights
- 2D platformer with tilemap-based levels
- Classic platforming feel with hazards and moving platforms
- Built with Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints and Paper2D

## Project Status
Active development. This is a fun project, but it is being built as a complete game. I will implement maps and levels after completing the core mechanics.

## Getting Started
1. Install Unreal Engine 5.
2. Open the project file: Classis_2DGame.uproject.
3. In the Content Browser, open the map at Content/Levels/1stLevel and click Play.

## Tech
- Unreal Engine 5
- Blueprints
- Paper2D
